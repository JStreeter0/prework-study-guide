        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Css: Cascading style sheets- Programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet </li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Style an element directly in HTML file useful for quick and permanent changes and less flexible than the other styles because each inline must be edited individually</li>
          <li>External CSS: Most common way to style a webpage because developers in most cases keep all their CSS rules in separate files making design changes easier </li>
          <li>What is separation of concerns? Separating code into different files based on use </li>
          <li>Selector: Defines element or attribute that rules or declarations will apply to</li>
          <li>Declarations include 2 important components: CSS property (we want to apply ex. color) and the value of the property (ex. blue)</li>
          <li>Margin Property: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element and the margin is not visible</li>
          <li>Padding Property: Adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>*: Declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties be the same</li>
          <li>DRY: Do not repeat yourself code- reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>.card: Class selector, any HTML assigned to the class will gain the property assignments from CSS</li>
          <li>CSS effects: You cas set multiple effects separated by a ;</li>
          <li> Colors can be assigned by naming color or hexidecimal code/ hex #</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git add -A: This command is used to commit all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description here": The -m flag is used to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messsages of the changes implemented</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Good habit to always pull the base branch into the feature branch before pushing up any code, should say Already up to date once ran</li>
          <li>git push origin "working branch looking to be pushed": This is used to push the changes</li>
          <li>git checkout: switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory (git checkout -b branch name- creates a new branch and switches to it)</li>
          <li>git status: Show modified files in working directory, staged for next commit (what branch we are currently on)</li>

          <li>JavaScript: The tool that takes static HTML/CSS webpages and makes the interactive</li>
          <li>Variable: A named container that allows us to store data in our code, start with let</li>
          <li>Control flow: The order in which a computer executes code in a script, can be interrupted by conditional statements and loops</li>
          <li>Semicolon: Indicator of where a statement ends, only required to seperat statements on a single but good practice to have at the end of each statement</li>
          <li>String: Is in single quote marks</li>
          <li>Number: Have no quote marks</li>
          <li>Boolean: True/False value, no quote marks</li>

          <li>Addition,subtraction,Multi, Division: Adds, subtracts, multiplys, or divides</li>
          <li>Assignment: Assigns value to a variable(ex. let myVariable= Bob</li>
          <li>Strict equality: Prefors test to see if two values equal(ex.let myt Variable =3; myVariable=== 4; True)</li>
          <li>Not, Does not equal: Returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes, turns true to false and tests whether values are not equal(ex. let myVariable=3; myVariable!==3; False)</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Code structures used to test if an expression is true or not(ex. ...else statement)</li>
          <li>Functions: Way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse by providing a set of instructions that tell the computer how to preform a task, functions do not auto run and must be given a name followed by ()</li>
          <li>Events: Code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response</li>
          <li>Primitive Values: Defined Immutable values</li>

          <li>Null: one value, null</li>

          <li>Numeric: two types, number and BigInt alongside related value NaN</li>
          <li>NaN: Not a number</li>
          <li>String Type: Represents textual data- length of string dependent on #of elements, once a string is created it can not be modified but can have a substring, strings must be contained with ""</li>
          <li>Symbol: Maybe used as key of object property some times called atoms</li>
          <li>Objects: A value in memory, two types being data property and accessor property</li>
          <li>Data Property: Associate a key with a value (value, writable, enumberable, configurable)</li>
          <li>Accessor Property: Associate a key with one or two accessor functions to retrieve or store a value (get, set, enumberable, configurable)</li>
          <li>Var: Declares variable</li>
          <li>=: To assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>console.log method: Easy way to test code</li>
          <li>Conditional Statement if: A way of introducing decision-making into code, code will only execute IF the statement meets the condition or is true</li>
          <li>Falsy: 0,-0,on, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a boolean data type with value of false</li>
          <li>Truthy: All other values or boolean with value of true</li>
          <li>Array: A single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>Index: Location of a data item in an array, first item in an array has an index of 0</li>
          <li>For loop: A loop that uses a predictable pattern to preform a task on all items in an array, has 3 important statements</li>
          <li>First Statement: Starting point of loop, first index is always 0 (ex. var x = 0) </li>
          <li>Second Statement: The condition (ex. x <Shapes.length;)</li>
          <li>Final Statement: Allows the array to iterate over each time (ex. x++ or x+1)</li>
